Color pickedColor = picker.PickColorFromImage(new Vector2(0.5f, 0.5f));
```

### Paint Color Capture
```csharp
PaintColorAnalyzer analyzer = GetComponent<PaintColorAnalyzer>();
Color paintColor = await analyzer.AnalyzePaintColorAsync(worldPosition);
```

### Color Comparison
```csharp
ColorMatcher matcher = GetComponent<ColorMatcher>();
ColorMatchResult result = matcher.CompareColors(referenceColor, paintColor);
Debug.Log($"Match Quality: {result.matchQuality}, Accuracy: {result.matchAccuracy:P1}");
```

### Complete Workflow
```csharp
ColorAnalyzer analyzer = GetComponent<ColorAnalyzer>();
ColorMatchResult result = await analyzer.QuickColorMatch(imageCoord, paintPosition);
// Automatically picks, captures, compares, and saves the match
```
