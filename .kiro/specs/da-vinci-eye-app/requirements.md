# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Da Vinci Eye app is a mixed reality application for HoloLens 2 that assists artists in creating fine art by providing digital overlay capabilities. The app allows users to define a physical canvas space, overlay reference images with adjustable opacity, and apply various visual filters to enhance the artistic creation process. This tool bridges traditional art techniques with modern mixed reality technology, enabling artists to trace, reference, and create artwork with enhanced precision and creative flexibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

5. WHEN color reduction filtering is applied THEN the system SHALL allow the user to reduce the total number of colors in the image to a specified count
6. WHEN a filter is applied THEN the system SHALL allow the user to adjust filter intensity and specific parameters
7. WHEN multiple filters are applied THEN the system SHALL allow layering of compatible filter effects
8. WHEN no filter is desired THEN the system SHALL provide an option to display the original unfiltered image
9. WHEN filter settings are changed THEN the system SHALL maintain filter preferences for the current session

### Requirement 4.1

**User Story:** As an artist, I want to filter images by specific color ranges, so that I can isolate and focus on particular color elements in my reference image.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN color range filtering is activated THEN the system SHALL provide controls for selecting target color ranges
2. WHEN a color range is defined THEN the system SHALL highlight only pixels within the specified hue, saturation, and brightness thresholds
3. WHEN color range parameters are adjusted THEN the system SHALL update the filtered display in real-time
4. WHEN multiple color ranges are selected THEN the system SHALL allow combining multiple color range filters
5. WHEN color range filtering is active THEN the system SHALL provide options to show filtered colors in original colors or as highlights

### Requirement 4.2

**User Story:** As an artist, I want to reduce the number of colors in the reference image, so that I can simplify complex images for easier artistic interpretation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN color reduction filtering is activated THEN the system SHALL provide controls to specify the target number of colors
2. WHEN the color count is reduced THEN the system SHALL use color quantization algorithms to preserve the most representative colors
3. WHEN color reduction parameters are changed THEN the system SHALL update the simplified image in real-time
4. WHEN color reduction is applied THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of the target color count from 2 to 256 colors
5. WHEN color reduction is active THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth color transitions while reducing overall palette complexity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an artist, I want intuitive hand gesture controls for all app functions, so that I can operate the app without interrupting my artistic workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is running THEN the system SHALL recognize standard HoloLens hand gestures for navigation
2. WHEN the user performs air tap gestures THEN the system SHALL respond to selection and activation commands
3. WHEN the user performs pinch and drag gestures THEN the system SHALL allow manipulation of UI elements and opacity controls
4. WHEN gesture controls are active THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback for recognized gestures
5. WHEN the user's hands are not visible THEN the system SHALL maintain current settings without accidental changes
6. WHEN gesture recognition fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative interaction methods

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an artist, I want to make adjustments to the reference image including cropping and exposure corrections, so that I can optimize the reference for my specific artistic needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria
